        Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean
        Abelialeaf) is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in
        the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species,
        Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai, endemic to Korea,
        where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only
        seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having
        white, not yellow, flowers.

        It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1–2 m tall. The leaves
        are opposite, simple, 6–10 cm long and 3-4.5 cm wide,
        pubescent both above and below. The flowers are pro-
        duced in early spring before the new leaves appear; they
        are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed
        corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2–3 cm di-
        ameter.
