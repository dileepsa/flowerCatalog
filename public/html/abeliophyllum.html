  <p>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean
    Abelialeaf) is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in
    the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species,
    Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai, endemic to Korea,
    where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only
    seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having
    white, not yellow, flowers.
    It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1–2 m tall. The leaves
    are opposite, simple, 6–10 cm long and 3-4.5 cm wide,

    pubescent both above and below. The flowers are pro-
    duced in early spring before the new leaves appear; they

    are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed

    corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2–3 cm di-
    ameter.

    It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North
    America.
